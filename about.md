# About Me

Hi! My name is Mike Smith, I am an Electrical and Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Queensland. From a young age, I have had a strong interest in science and technology, particularly in the field of healthcare. This interest led me to pursue a dual degree in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a foundation in Electrical Engineering, learning new skills in areas such as circuit design, signal processing and programming. Furthermore, my focus on Biomedical Engineering has provided me with a deep understanding of the human body's inner workings and the application of technology in medical devices. I have delved into subjects such as biomedical instrumentation, medical imaging and biomedical device engineering, equipping me with the tools to understand medical technologies that have the potential to enhance healthcare.

As I continue my journey as an Electrical and Biomedical Engineering student, I am excited to dive deeper into new technologies and contribute to the continuously evolving field of Biomedical Engineering. I hope to make a difference in the lives of individuals through the combination of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering principles and advancements.
